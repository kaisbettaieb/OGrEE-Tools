## Compile
The plugin is written in Ruby, but in order for plugins to be registrable in Sketchup PRO 2023, you **must** compile the code to a **.rbz** compressed file.

To do that, you must :
1. Create a **.zip** compressed file that contains all the **.rb** files of the plugin
2. Change the compressed file extension to **.rbz**

*Optional*: You can use the batch script below to automate the compilation of the plugin
```bash 
@echo off

rem Define the directory to zip, a directory that contains the implementation of the plugin
set "dir_to_zip=skp2ocli"

rem Define the file to include, a file that contains the declaration and metadata of the plugins
set "file_to_include=skp2ocli.rb"

rem Build the zip file
set "zip_name=skp2ocli.zip"
if exist "skp2ocli.rbz" (
  del /q "skp2ocli.rbz"
  echo Deleted existing zip file: skp2ocli.rbz
)
PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoProfile -Command "& { Compress-Archive -Path %dir_to_zip%* -DestinationPath %zip_name%}"echo Created zip file: %zip_name%
rem Rename the temporary zip to the desired name
ren "%zip_name%" "skp2ocli.rbz"

echo renamed zip file: skp2ocli.rbz

pause
```

*NB*: The output file will be saved in the directory where the script was executed
